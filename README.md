Adversary Simulation: Using Blue Eyes to See Red
================================================

Presentation given by Fred Wilmot and Sebastien Tricaud at Defcon 32 Red Team Village.

There is no better way to accurately describe attacks than using Adel, our description language is designed to help understanding how attack operates.
We use this description to generate data so we can perform unit test and fuzz detections.

In this folder you will find attack description used for our presentation to help you learn how to best describe attacks:
* Start with Stage1 and learn how to craft a DNS tunnel evasion attack
* Stage2 (GoBruteforcer) where you can compare side by side the threat report by Palo Alto unit42 team screenshots and description with our generated pcap
* Splunk: how Splunk queries can be mapped to attack descriptions to generate a sample windows sysmon event
* Scenarios: scenarios which can be used to generate data and understand details on how such attacks operate.
* STIX: sample STIX files to use to create Adel
* BuildingBlocks: Adel code snippets
